Five Crowns Scoresheet is a personal project designed to enhance your experience of the popular card game Five Crowns. Whether you're playing with a small group or up to 21 players (meaning: this allow you to play with 3 decks) this app simplifies scorekeeping, allowing you to focus on the fun. Inspired by my own experiences of playing with multiple decks when we exceeded the standard player limit, this tool ensures that everyone can join in on the action. Say goodbye to the hassle of manual score tracking and enjoy a seamless gaming experience with Five Crowns Scoresheet!
